Description: Methods for quality control and exploratory analysis of surface 
  water quality data collected in Massachusetts, USA.  Functions are developed 
  to facilitate data formatting for the Water Quality Exchange Network 
  <https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/water-quality-data-upload-wqx> and reporting 
  of data quality objectives to state agencies. Quality control methods are 
  from Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (2020) 
  <https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massachusetts-department-of-environmental-protection>.
