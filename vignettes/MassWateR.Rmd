## Overview

The MassWateR R package is developed for surface water monitoring data collected by watershed associations and citizen science groups in Massachusetts. The package is created in collaboration with the [Massachusetts Bays National Estuary Partnership](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massachusetts-bays-national-estuary-partnership){target="_blank"} with funding from an EPA Exchange Network Grant.

The objective of the package is to automate and facilitate quality control and exploratory analysis of data intended for upload to the EPA [Water Quality Exchange](https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/water-quality-data){target="_blank"} (WQX). The functions provide a streamlined and repeatable means of 1) screening data for quality control, 2) summarizing quality control results, 3) creating graphics for analysis and reports to stakeholders, and 4)formatting data for upload to WQX. The functions are organized around these topics, shown below.

```{r workflow, out.width = '100%', echo = F, fig.cap = 'Functions in MassWateR are organized around these topics.'}
knitr::include_graphics("workflow.PNG")
```

In addition to the content on this web page, the MassWateR Community of Practice forum is a space for users to find help, share ideas, and suggest improvements for the package.  Please follow the [link](https://massbays.discourse.group/c/masswater-r-tools/5){target="_blank"} to register and login to the forum.

Instructions on installing R and Rstudio can be found [here](https://massbays-tech.github.io/intro-to-r/setup.html){target="_blank"} and on the [Resources](https://massbays-tech.github.io/MassWateR/RESOURCES.html) tab. 

## Package installation

Install the package as follows:

```{r, eval = F}
# Enable universe(s) by massbays-tech
options(repos = c(
  massbaystech = "https://massbays-tech.r-universe.dev",
  CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))

# Install the package
install.packages("MassWateR")
```

Windows PC users may encounter the following warning when installing MassWateR.

```r
WARNING: Rtools is required to build R packages but is not currently installed. Please download and install the appropriate version of Rtools before proceeding: https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/
```

This warning can be ignored.  If desired, RTools can be obtained following the instructions [here](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/){target="_blank"}.

Load the package in an R session after installation:

```{r}
library(MassWateR)
```

## Data inputs

Please view the [data inputs and checks](https://massbays-tech.github.io/MassWateR/articles/inputs.html) vignette for a complete description of the data requirements for MassWateR.

Four types of data are used with the MassWateR package: surface water quality results, data quality objectives for accuracy, frequency, and completeness, site metadata, and wqx metadata.

The following shows how to specify a path and import each required data file.  These are hypothetical files and the path will need to be changed to where your data are located on your computer. Templates and instructions for each of the types of input data are available for download in the [Resources tab](/MassWateR/RESOURCES.md).  

```{r, eval = F}
# import results data
respth <- "C:/Documents/MassWateR/MyResults.xlsx"
resdat <- readMWRresults(respth)

# import dqo accuracy data
accpth <- "C:/Documents/MassWateR/MyDQOAccuracy.xlsx"
accdat <- readMWRacc(accpth)

# import dqo frequency and completeness data
frecompth <- "C:/Documents/MassWateR/MyDQOFreCom.xlsx"
frecomdat <- readMWRfrecom(frecompth)

# import site data
sitpth <- "C:/Documents/MassWateR/MySites.xlsx"
sitdat <- readMWRsites(sitpth)

# import WQX meta data
wqxpth <- "C:/Documents/MassWateR/MyWQXMeta.xlsx"
wqxdat <- readMWRwqx(wqxpth)
```

After data are imported, a single data object can be created that can be used with all MassWateR functions. 

```{r, eval = F}
# a list of input data frames
fsetls <- list(
  res = resdat, 
  acc = accdat,
  frecom = frecomdat,
  sit = sitdat, 
  wqx = wqxdat
)
```

Example files included with the package are imported for demonstration in this vignette. Your data import code will look more like the one above.  A series of checks are run on each file on import.

```{r, warning = F}
# results data
respth <- system.file("extdata/ExampleResults.xlsx", package = "MassWateR")
resdat <- readMWRresults(respth)

# import results data
respth <- system.file("extdata/ExampleResults.xlsx", package = "MassWateR")
resdat <- readMWRresults(respth)

# import data quality objectives for accuracy
accpth <- system.file("extdata/ExampleDQOAccuracy.xlsx", package = "MassWateR")
accdat <- readMWRacc(accpth)

# import data quality objectives for frequency and completeness
frecompth <- system.file("extdata/ExampleDQOFrequencyCompleteness.xlsx", package = "MassWateR")
frecomdat <- readMWRfrecom(frecompth)

# import site metadata
sitpth <- system.file("extdata/ExampleSites.xlsx", package = "MassWateR")
sitdat <- readMWRsites(sitpth)

# import wqx metadata
wqxpth <- system.file("extdata/ExampleWQX.xlsx", package = "MassWateR")
wqxdat <- readMWRwqx(wqxpth)
```
```{r, eval = T, echo = F}
# a list of input data frames
fsetls <- list(
  res = resdat, 
  acc = accdat,
  frecom = frecomdat,
  sit = sitdat, 
  wqx = wqxdat
)
```

The `readMWRresultsview()` function can be used to help troubleshoot issues that are encountered importing the water quality results file. This function can be used to create a .csv spreadsheet that shows the unique values within columns of the results file.  This information can be used to verify if the values in each conform to the requirements for the data import checks. 

```{r, eval = F}
# find path to the file included with the package, replace with a path to your file as needed
respth <- system.file("extdata/ExampleResults.xlsx", package = "MassWateR")

# create a .csv file for the two columns that show unique values in each
readMWRresultsview(respth, columns = c("Characteristic Name", "Result Unit"))
```

## Quality control functions

Please view the [quality control functions](https://massbays-tech.github.io/MassWateR/articles/qcoverview.html) vignette for a complete description of the quality control functions in MassWateR.

The `qcMWRreview()` function compiles a report as a Word document for all quality control checks included in the MassWateR package.  The report shows several tables, including the data quality objectives files for accuracy, frequency, and completeness, summary results for all accuracy checks, summary results for all frequency checks, summary results for all completeness checks, and individual results for all accuracy checks.

The report can be created as follows.  Once the function is done running, a message indicating success and where the file is located is returned.  The Word file can be further edited by hand as needed.  

```{r, message = T, eval = F}
qcMWRreview(fset = fsetls)
```

## Outlier checks

Please view the [outlier checks](https://massbays-tech.github.io/MassWateR/articles/outlierchecks.html) vignette for a complete description of the outlier check functions in MassWateR.

The `anlzMWRoutlier()` function can identify outliers for a selected parameter using boxplots, with the outliers labelled accordingly.

```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
anlzMWRoutlier(fset = fsetls, param = "DO", group = "month")
```

Outlier plots for all parameters in the results data file can be created using the `anlzMWRoutlierall()` function. This can be used to create a word document with all plots embedded in the file or as separate png images saved to a specified directory. Once the function is done running, a message indicating success and where the file(s) is located is returned.  

```{r, message = T, eval = F}
anlzMWRoutlierall(fset = fsetls, group = "month")
```

## Analyses

Please view the [analyses](https://massbays-tech.github.io/MassWateR/articles/analysis.html) vignette for a complete description of the analysis functions in MassWateR.

The analysis functions in MassWateR can be used to evaluate trends, summaries, and maps. 

Analyze results by season: 

```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
anlzMWRseason(fset = fsetls, param = "DO", thresh = "fresh")
```

Analyze results by date:

```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
anlzMWRdate(fset = fsetls, param = "DO", thresh = "fresh", site = c("ABT-026", "ABT-077"))
```

Analyze data by site:

```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
anlzMWRsite(fset = fsetls, param = "DO", thresh = "fresh")
```

Analyze results with maps:

```{r, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 6}
anlzMWRmap(fset = fsetls, param = "DO")
```

## Modifying plots

Please view the [modifying plots](https://massbays-tech.github.io/MassWateR/articles/modifying.html) vignette for a complete description of how plots created in MassWateR can be modified by hand.  All of the plots created for the outlier and general analysis functions are [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/index.html) plots and can be modified accordingly, in addition to the supplied arguments to the core functions. 

## Water Quality Exchange output

Please view the [Water Quality Exchange output](https://massbays-tech.github.io/MassWateR/articles/wqx.html) vignette for a complete description of creating output for WQX upload with MassWateR.

The single function for generating output for upload to WQX is `tabMWRwqx()`.  This function will export a single Excel workbook with three sheets, named "Project", "Locations", and "Results". The output is populated with as much content as possible, but it is the responsibility of the user to verify this information is complete and correct before uploading the data. Additional information may need to be added by hand. Once the function is done running, a message indicating success and where the file is located is returned. 

```{r, eval = F}
tabMWRwqx(fset = fsetls)
```

## Uploading data to WQX

If desired, all rows from the WQX output file (created with `taxMWRwqx()`) can be copied and pasted into the [WQX upload template](https://massbays-tech.github.io/MassWateR/WQX_Phys-Chem_Template_for_MassWateR.xlsx) (also available on the [Resources](https://massbays-tech.github.io/MassWateR/RESOURCES.html) tab), which offers an enhanced spreadsheet layout with more interactive functionality (e.g., drop-down lists, prompts) and additional tabs with supporting information (e.g., instructions, field definitions). This template is especially useful if manual edits to the data are needed prior to WQX upload.

To upload data to WQX, you will need to create or sign into [your WQX account](https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/wqx-web-account-registration){target="_blank"}. From there, you can upload your Projects, Locations, and Results spreadsheets individually. Note that Projects and Locations need only be uploaded once for your organization, unless the data change. For each spreadsheet upload, assign the appropriate MassWateR custom import configuration, check that your Organization ID is assigned, browse to your upload file, and select Import Data (image below). The next screen will notify you of upload status and prompt you to correct any errors or warnings that arise. More information on error resolution can be found in the [WQX User Guide](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-03/documents/wqx_web_user_guide_v3.0.pdf){target="_blank"}.

```{r wqximport, out.width = '100%', echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("WQX_import.png")
```

## Submitting data to Mass DEP

If you are submitting your data to Mass DEP, you must follow all of their instructions as described on their [External Data Submittal](https://www.mass.gov/guides/external-data-submittals-to-the-watershed-planning-program){target="_blank"} webpage. Data and QC data can be submitted using either the MassDEP data submission template OR by uploading data to WQX. If you are submitting through WQX you should complete the submission by notifying Mass DEP via email ([WQData.Submit@mass.gov](mailto:WQData.Submit@mass.gov){target="_blank"}).  The e-mail must include the group name / project name under which the data was submitted to WQX, a copy of the project QAPP (if not already submitted), a statement of data integrity, the MassWateR QC Report (with the raw data print out), and any other supporting data reports.
